Isn't it great?

### Potentialities upon which I am working

today's [`i r b0gie`](https://twitter.com/1rb0g1e) brings us here back to the moment of our first post.

we recall events of beggining, and the moment we started to work on this project.

it was [clear](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4b3a54a3bed69107972a80f7c70a2aaf/tumblr_nsjoqd1xXV1ucdb23o1_540.gifv) that we were not ready to start working on this project.

the techshaman said `yexzu is coming` as i approched the tehtehcshannam.

no feeling of dread now.

now i feel the hope of victory, it feels like my life is possible once again. `starting anew`.

.\reb0rn with purpose.
